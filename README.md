# Montavie Form Experimentation

This web application was an experimentation on Angular development and working with Angular reactive forms to create a dynamic, secure, and efficient posts. Montavie's vision was to be a social media website that allows users to post modular multiform content about outdoor activities and trips where customization is at the forefront of the user journey. In this project, modules are broken up into subcomponents of the form and work in with the Angular CDK to allow Drag-and-Drop.

The other parts of the web application were developed seperately in a different directory, such as users, image storage, comments, feed, multiple API integrations, and several other components.

Proceeds go towards benefiting the environment and reducing carbon emissions.
